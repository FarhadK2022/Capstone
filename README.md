# GetThere

## About
GetThere is a clone that was inspired by Turo. The site is all about finding the fastest and most enjoyable vehicles to get you from A to B. This site can be used by anyone who is of legal driving age with their drivers license.

This project is a passion project for me because I am a huge car-lover. Turo had all of the right functionality, but many of the cars seemed too standard and boring. I wanted a place for fellow gear-heads to find a car that would be fun to rent.

I enjoyed making this site, and I hope you enjoy using it as well! Updates are rolling in on additional features, so check back periodically to experience the growth with me!

To start, you can use the Live link listed below, or follow the steps listed for running the site locally.

Steps to run locally:

1. Download the repository zip file from the main GitHub page.
2. Open the file on your local machine.
3. Run `npm install` in the root directory.
4. Next, open two terminals: one that will run everything in the backend directory, and one for the frontend directory.
5. Run `npm install` in both directories.
6. In the backend directory, use the following commands to migrate and seed your data:
   `npx dotenv sequelize-cli db:migrate` and `npx dotenv sequelize-cli db:seed:all`
7. Use `npm start` in both frontend and backend directories to get the project up and running.
8. Enjoy!
