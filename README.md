# GetThere

## About
GetThere is a clone that was inspired by Turo. The site is all about finding the fastest and most enjoyable vehicles to get you from A to B. This site can be used by anyone who is of legal driving age with their drivers license.
This project is a passion project for me because I am a huge car-lover. Turo had all of the right functionality, but many of the cars seemed too standard and boring. I wanted a place for fellow gear-heads to find a car that would be fun to rent.
I enjoyed making this site, and I hope you enjoy using it as well! Updates are rolling in on additional features, so check back periodically to experience the growth with me!
